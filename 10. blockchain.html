#Lemma 1 (technical) : merkle tree

#Lemma 2 (sociology) : intersubjective reality
- Yuval Noah Harari : Sapiens and Homo Deus
- Objective reality vs subjective reality
- Examples of intersubjective reality: religions, countries, money…

---

#Classical story of money
- Limited supply
- Fongibility
- No double spending/creating money

---

#Historical examples
- Gold
- Rai stones
- Fiat money
- Bank bills

#Virtual money
- Paypal
- Every bank account

???
We are working just to increase a number in a a database, hoping that this number has some value.

#How to implement decentralised virtual money?
- Using lemma 1

---
class: center, middle

#Blockchain
- Distributed Ledger
- Consensus algorithm
- Need to be opensource by design

???
If not opensource, it is not a true blockchain. It cannot be distributed if not opensource.

#Other consensus algorthim
- Proof Of Stake
- Delegated Proof Of Stake
- Proof of space
- …


???
Currently, none have been demonstrated as reliable and secure consensus algorithms.

#Permissioned vs Permissionless

???
Permissioned blockchains are mainly marketing bullshit. Think about a huge excel spreadsheet which is very hard to maintain.

#How to create value?
- Using lemma 2

???
If people start to see value in a virtual currency, it becomes the value.

---
class: center, middle

#Bitcoin
- Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009
- The 15,000 BTC pizza, 2010
- First bubble to 30$ in 2011
- Second bubble to 1200$ in 2013
- Third bubble to 19000$ in 2017

#A word about the price
- Market fixes the price. Market is a crowd.
- Bear vs bull
- Short vs long
- HODL, trading, scalping

???

All of that applies to any exchanged value

---
class: center, middle

#Cryptocurrency vs ERC20 token

???
Cryptocurrency has its own blockchain (BTC, LTC, ETH,…)
ERC20 is a standard smart-contract based on the Ethereum blockchain.

---
class: center, middle

#The vertical database problem
- There's always a need for a human "translator"

???
Anecdote with containers, with administration (my own diploma here at University), with Proximus at home.

#Blockchain is the first horizontal database

---
class: center, middle

#Consequences
- Transparence
- Accountability
- Decentralisation

???
Accountability because having a private key is a synonym to an identity (even if that identity might be anonymous)

#A world about decentralisation

#Uncentralisability

class: center, middle

#Impact on the world?
- Blockchains are a way to take a decentralised decision

---
class: center, middle

#Human institutions…
…are only a way to take a decision

???
Families, countries, student cercles, sport team, federation…
All are just intersubjective reality group built in order to take collective decisions in the name of the group.

#An ecological disaster?

---
class: center, middle

#It might not be the case
- Most mined electricity comes from wasted source
- It might change the dynamic of the power market
- What's the value of a distributed database ?

???
Currently, it is still an experiment. It's not about how much electricity it consumes but about the ratio CO2 emitted/usefulness. Which is currently very hard to quantify.
